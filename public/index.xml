      <title>gem_scd shiny app</title>
      <link>/project/internal-project/gem-scd-shiny-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/internal-project/gem-scd-shiny-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This post is quite old, and from a previous version of my website. You can find the published version of this article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00273171.2018.1466681&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a paper under submission with James E. Pustejovsky titled &amp;ldquo;A gradual effects model for single-case designs&amp;rdquo; (preprint &lt;a href=&#34;https://psyarxiv.com/vh964/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The paper proposes a particular form of nonlinear parametric model for single-case designs that offers some flexibility in functional form and error distribution that many of the other parametric models for single-case designs don&amp;rsquo;t. However, one tricky part of it is that there&amp;rsquo;s not a straightforward way to estimate the particular form of the linear predictor we specify for our proposed model using any of the typical modeling packages in R. To estimate the model we profile the likelihood (or quasi-likelihood), and I wrote functions in R to do that. Those functions can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jepusto/SingleCaseES&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SingleCaseES package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, it&amp;rsquo;s a worry that applied practitioners might not want to use R functions. Chances are good that single-case researchers have never touched R in their life, and even with step by step instructions they may go out of their way to avoid it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/gem-scd/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;So I built a calculator (with some design guidance from James)&lt;/a&gt;. Note: James has a very limited data budget on his shinyapps account so by the mid-to-end of the month the website might not be available. If you want to see it, the following code in R should open it up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;sourcetools&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;shiny&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;markdown&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;purrrlyr&amp;quot;)
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;jepusto/SingleCaseES&amp;quot;)
library(SingleCaseES)
shine_gem_scd()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app has self-contained instructions, a calculator for estimating the model for a single data series, as well as a batch calculator for estimating the model for a dataset containing multiple series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the paper is accepted for publication, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a slightly lengthier blog post/tutorial for its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consulting enquiries should be sent to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:consulting@dmswan.com&#34;&gt;consulting@dmswan.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;general-experience.&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Experience.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three years I worked at the University of Texas for the College of Education’s Research Support unit as a methodological consultant on research design and statistical analysis. I worked primarily with graduate students and occasionally assisted with faculty analyses. I have experience with offering quantitative methodological assistance at all stages of the research process. I am an advanced user in R and comfortable with MPLUS. I have also assisted researchers in performing analyses in SPSS and STATA (including complex models like multi-level models and structural equation modeling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student I have taken courses involving: multi-level models, structural equation modeling (various kinds of factor analysis and other latent models), item response theory, meta-analysis, causal inference (regression discontinuity designs, propensity score analyses, etc.), and generalized linear models in addition to the typical t-tests, chi squares, and regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal methodological research involves single-case designs (a particular form of research design common in special education), generalized linear models, and is meta-analysis adjacent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;services-offered&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Services offered:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating research questions.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes researchers have identified an area of research they are interested in but need assistance formulating their research questions. This stage is important, because research questions can dictate both the kind of data that need to be gathered and the type of analysis that must be conducted to properly answer that question. Occasionally, inexperienced researchers have one kind of question or research project in mind, and accidentally formulate research questions that imply something quite different. Often minor revisions to research questions can significantly change the implied design and analysis to more closely match the expectations of the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing a statistical model or measurement tool.&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, researchers have very clear ideas about the questions that they want to ask, but are not entirely certain about an appropriate statistical model. In other cases, researchers are sometimes unaware of the consequences of their sampling methods. For instance, in education data, student outcomes are often clustered in classrooms, schools, and districts. If a researcher fails to account for this in their statistical analysis, this can result in significant violations of analytic assumptions and cause biases in their results. Finally, researchers may have outcomes or covariates they would like to measure but are not sure what the appropriate measurement method is. In these cases, I can help researchers choose appropriate methods for their research questions and samples, as well as provide guidance about the selection and use of appropriate measurement tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conducting a power analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Performing a power analysis for a full study is important to ensure that researchers are likely to find a statistically significant result, assuming that a substantively meaningful effect is present. In addition, grant proposals often require that researchers perform a power analysis for their intended analytic method. However, power analysis can be tricky. There are tools like G*Power, PowerUp!, and Optimal Design for a variety of analyses, however they can be opaque. In the case of models with latent outcomes, such as structural equation modeling, the use of Monte Carlo simulations may be required to assess the necessary sample size for a desired power. In addition, finding all statistical values that need to be specified in a power analysis can be difficult, as some of them are often not typically part of published research. I can help guide researchers through the power analysis process with existing software tools or assist in the design and execution of a Monte Carlo simulation power analysis, as well as help researchers figure out appropriate values to be used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assist with statistical analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; For more advanced analyses, researchers are sometimes not comfortable performing them alone. I am happy to help researchers with every step in the analysis process, from cleaning their data, writing code/pointing and clicking on the right spots in software, troubleshooting difficulties in analysis the researchers began independently, all the way up to assisting in the interpretation of the results of an analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;preparing-for-consultation&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preparing for consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our first session:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are interested in my consulting services, the first step is to schedule an introductory meeting. I need to understand the scope and context of your research in order to figure out how I can be of assistance. An introductory meeting typically takes about one hour and is free of charge. For our introductory meeting to be productive, it’s important to prepare carefully in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to prepare is to write down what you know about your project in a brief memo. I imagine this as roughly one page. This is not necessarily something you are going to give to me, it’s to help you organize your thoughts. In this memo, you should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the research questions you are interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about the population of interest (e.g. first graders, students who speak English as their second language, LGBTQ teens, High School math students, depressed adults).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the kinds of outcomes you want to measure. If you have a specific way of measuring them (such as a particular standardized test), bring the reference that describes the design of that measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note particular statistical analyses you are interested in performing, and if there is a particular software you would like to use to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include other details that you think are important for a general understanding of your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be ready to talk about how much of this you were hoping we would work on collaboratively versus what you want me to work on and come back to you with. In a consulting session we typically sit together and work on analysis tasks together. Working collaboratively might take more time, but for many consulting projects you will be better prepared to write about the results and discuss them with your peers after collaborative sessions. You might also be better equipped to perform analyses for yourself in the future. I am also comfortable doing some discrete tasks alone and providing you with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;next-steps&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our introductory meeting, if I believe I can be helpful on the project I will write a document describing how I understand the scope of the work, as well as my rate for the work. Once you have agreed to the scope of the work and the rate, we can get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So long as the work necessary to complete your project doesn’t substantially exceed the agreed-upon scope of work, my rate for the work will not change. If the direction of the project changes or the scope of the work changes substantially, I reserve the right to reassess my fees or my involvement in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;rate&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal consulting rate starts at a &lt;strong&gt;minimum&lt;/strong&gt; of $100 per hour, but can be higher for particularly difficult or unusual tasks. Our introductory consultation will be free of charge. All consultation fees are due at the end of any given consulting meeting. For discrete tasks that I perform outside of your presence, I will do my best to give you an accurate estimate of how long it will take, but it might take longer than anticipated. Please keep me aware of budget concerns/limitations you have. For especially lengthy tasks, I reserve the right to request half of the anticipated fee up-front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consulting enquiries should be sent to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:consulting@dmswan.com&#34;&gt;consulting@dmswan.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
