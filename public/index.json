The validity of a statistical method rests on whether its assumptions are plausible representations of the process by which the data were collected, yet there is evidence that some assumptions—particularly regarding normality of error distributions—may be inappropriate for single-case data. To develop more appropriate modelling assumptions and statistical methods, researchers must attend to the features of real SCD data. In this study, we examine several features of SCDs with behavioral outcome measures in order to inform development of statistical methods. Drawing on a corpus of over 300 studies, including approximately 1800 cases, from seven systematic reviews that cover a range of interventions and outcome constructs, we report the distribution of study designs, distribution of outcome measurement procedures, and features of baseline outcome data distributions for the most common types of measurements used in single-case research. We discuss implications for the development of more realistic assumptions regarding outcome distributions in SCD studies, as well as the design of Monte Carlo simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical analysis techniques for SCED data.","tags":null,"title":"An examination of measurement procedures and characteristics of baseline outcome data in single-case research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Project"],"content":"NOTE: This post is quite old, and from a previous version of my website. You can find the published version of this article here\nI have a paper under submission with James E. Pustejovsky titled \u0026ldquo;A gradual effects model for single-case designs\u0026rdquo; (preprint here). The paper proposes a particular form of nonlinear parametric model for single-case designs that offers some flexibility in functional form and error distribution that many of the other parametric models for single-case designs don\u0026rsquo;t. However, one tricky part of it is that there\u0026rsquo;s not a straightforward way to estimate the particular form of the linear predictor we specify for our proposed model using any of the typical modeling packages in R. To estimate the model we profile the likelihood (or quasi-likelihood), and I wrote functions in R to do that. Those functions can be found in the SingleCaseES package.\nEven then, it\u0026rsquo;s a worry that applied practitioners might not want to use R functions. Chances are good that single-case researchers have never touched R in their life, and even with step by step instructions they may go out of their way to avoid it. So I built a calculator (with some design guidance from James).

There has been growing interest in systematic reviews and syntheses of evidence from single-case designs, but there remains a need to further develop appropriate statistical models and effect sizes for data from the designs. We propose a novel model for single-case data that exhibit nonlinear time trends created by an intervention that produces gradual effects, which build up and dissipate over time. The model expresses a structural relationship between a pattern of treatment assignment and an outcome variable, making it appropriate for both treatment reversal and multiple baseline designs. It is formulated as a generalized linear model so that it can be applied to outcomes measured as frequency counts or proportions, both of which are commonly used in single-case research, while providing readily interpretable effect size estimates such as log response ratios or log odds ratios. We demonstrate the gradual effects model by applying it to data from a single-case study and examine the performance of proposed estimation methods in a Monte Carlo simulation of frequency count data.","tags":null,"title":"A gradual effects model for single-case designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JE Pustejovsky","DM Swan"],"categories":null,"content":"https://www.jepusto.com/software/singlecasees/\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"45c98c5f5df371fe9999cc3fe33236e8","permalink":"/publication/pustejovsky-2017-single/","publishdate":"2019-10-28T01:59:33.070644Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pustejovsky-2017-single/","section":"publication","summary":"https://www.jepusto.com/software/singlecasees/","tags":null,"title":"Single-case effect size calculator web application","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"\rR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.

It is used in several areas of educational and psychological research, particularly in connection with single-case research. Measurements collected using partial interval recording suffer from construct invalidity because they are not readily interpretable in terms of the underlying characteristics of the behavior. Using an alternating renewal process model for the behavior under observation, we demonstrate that ignoring the construct invalidity of PIR data can produce misleading inferences, such as inferring that an intervention reduces the prevalence of an undesirable behavior when in fact it has the opposite effect. We then propose four different methods for analyzing PIR summary measurements, each of which can be used to draw inferences about interpretable behavioral parameters. We demonstrate the methods by applying them to data from two single-case studies of problem behavior.","tags":null,"title":"Four methods for analyzing partial interval recording data, with application to single-case research","type":"publication"}]
