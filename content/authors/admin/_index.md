I am research associate working remotely for [Dr. Emily Tanner-Smith](https://education.uoregon.edu/people/faculty/etanners) at the University of Oregon. I provide support for evidence reviewer training for the [What Works Clearinghouse](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/) for both in-person training sessions and the online group design training system. I also assist in the revision and refinement of the WWC's Standards and Procedures Handbooks. I also spend a small amount of time each month working as a part of the of the Prevention science Institute statistical analysis support unit at UO.

My personal research primarily involves the analysis and meta-analysis of single-case designs (SCDs) in the context of education. I am particularly interested in the quality indicators of primary studies, the different kinds of inferences made in SCDs, and how the common, frequently unspoken research practices in this field might impact the intervention estimates from these kinds of studies.

I have also worked in collaboration with [Dr. James E. Pustejovsky](http://jepusto.github.io/) on research involving single-case designs, the direct observation of behavior, meta-analysis, and generalized linear models. My dissertation, chaired by [Dr. S. Natasha Beretvas](https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/susan_beretvas) and co-chaired by Dr. Pustejovsky involved examining the impact of response-guided designs on treatment effect estimates from single-case designs. I was a consultant for the College of Education's [research design and statistical analysis consulting unit](https://education.utexas.edu/research/about-smarter-consulting), I offered graduate students feedback and guidance on their research design and appropriate statistical analysis, tutored them on the use of statistical software, and help them to interpret their output and at least once a semester, I also provided a free, multi-day introductory workshop in using R.
